# Reward-Optimizing Learning using Stochastic Release Plasticity

This repository provides the implementation of RSRP, a biologically inspired synaptic plasticity rule that models synaptic transmission as a parameterized Bernoulli distribution and optimizes release probabilities using natural gradient estimation. This rule enables robust and effective learning in both reinforcement learning and supervised learning settings, with plausible neurobiological mechanisms such as reward-modulated synaptic updates and EI-balanced networks.

## 🌟 Highlight
+ ✔️ A unified plasticity rule for both RL and classification tasks
+ ✔️ Competitive with PPO in reinforcement learning
+ ✔️ Near backpropagation-level accuracy in classification
+ ✔️ Support for biologically plausible networks (e.g., EI balance, sparse reward)
+ ✔️ Implemented entirely in JAX, with support for OpenAI Gym and Brax
